Primary skills: Covert operations...

4
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:15,098
...unarmed combat, firearms, explosives...

5
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:18,434
...asset acquisition, enemy agent disposal.

6
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:20,687
Current status: Missing.

7
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,563
MALORY:
For three months.

8
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:26,693
Sterling's been missing for three months
and you idiots have nothing.

11
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:34,617
Anywhere.
Which is where Archer could be.

12
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:37,912
Malory, we've checked every safe house,
run down every lead.

13
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,125
And he hasn't touched any
of his bank accounts, so unless he... Oh.

14
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,836
Were you gonna say,
"Unless he's been skimming cash...

15
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:47,296
...from his operations accounts
all these years"?

16
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:50,383
Yeah, duh, right?
He wouldn't dare steal from me.

17
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,135
Oh, please, we all...

18
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:55,346
Think he would dare to do that.

19
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:58,099
So we've got a highly-ish skilled
covert agent...

20
00:00:58,267 --> 00:01:00,852
...who probably has millions of dollars
in cash.

21
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,437
Who doesn't want to be found.

22
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:05,440
Being looked for by people
who don't want to find him.

23
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:06,733
Whatever.
Meaning whom?

24
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,319
Oh, don't give me that.
You're all secretly delighted that he's gone.

25
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:14,157
Well, I wouldn't say delighted, but...
I cannot say I miss the bullying.

26
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:17,660

Plus ISIS actually turned a profit this quarter.

No, never mind.

29

Because since you've all been
half-assedly phoning it in...

30
00:01:24,168 --> 00:01:28,337
Malory, he can't be found.
I mean, if he's even still, um...

31
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:32,175
Still what?
Alive.

32
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:36,012
Jeez. Ow. Talk about "duh."
I bet he already totally killed himself.

33
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,973
No, he didn't. What's wrong with you?

34
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:41,726
Nothing.
Because my skeevy Russian fiancée...

35
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:45,354
...wasn't murdered in front of my very eyeballs
at my stupid wedding.

BARRY: Whoo!

39
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:54,322

Now both our weddings are canceled.

Ha, ha, ha.
Is that how you crash a wedding?

00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:02,997
Yes, it is, Bionic Barry. Yes, it is.

43
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:07,794
No. No matter how distraught Sterling
is over Katya, he won't kill himself.

44
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,212
He'd never do that to me.

45
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:12,173
He's alive somewhere,
and since you fools can't find him...

46
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:14,467

I'm worried half to death about Sterling, and...

called Wapuni in French Polynesia.

was somebody ordered room service...

76

...but the regular room-service guy, he died,
so I came in here and then I fell on the bed.

that other guy, he's never coming back to ISIS.
