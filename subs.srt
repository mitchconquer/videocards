1
00:00:02,819 --> 00:00:04,720
Aw c'maaaahn!

2
00:00:04,789 --> 00:00:08,255
Clock yer skinny ass out already, and
let's go get outside some dranks!

3
00:00:08,324 --> 00:00:09,423
Ugh, I can't!

4
00:00:09,492 --> 00:00:12,459
I have to cover her stupid
phone in case those stupid

5
00:00:12,528 --> 00:00:16,131
pirates call with a stupid ransom
demand for Mr. Stupid Archer!

6
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:16,831
Carol?!

7
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,466
Carol! Have they called?!

8
00:00:18,535 --> 00:00:20,803
No! Ma'am!

9
00:00:20,871 --> 00:00:24,639
But rest assured I'll let you
know the minute they dooo!

10
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:25,340
Rest?

11
00:00:25,409 --> 00:00:29,311
- My God, who can rest...
- Not me, apparently.

12
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:30,079
Or me!

13
00:00:30,148 --> 00:00:33,348
I have to re-do the annual
budget because she's blowing it

14
00:00:33,417 --> 00:00:35,717
all on this so-called
rescue of Archer!

15
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:38,919
Well his plane did crash,
and the distress signal was last

16
00:00:38,988 --> 00:00:42,722
heard coming from a known pirate
fortress, so... - So?!

17
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:46,258
That doesn't mean Ray and Lana have
to bankrupt ISIS getting there!

18
00:00:46,327 --> 00:00:47,859
Oh, would you relax?

19
00:00:47,928 --> 00:00:49,594
You rent a boat,
that money's gone.

20
00:00:49,663 --> 00:00:51,763
This way, we can sell
it when we're done.

21
00:00:51,831 --> 00:00:52,997
I bet it'll come out cheaper.

22
00:00:53,066 --> 00:00:55,000
I wasn't talking
about the boat.

23
00:00:55,069 --> 00:00:57,502
I think five grand
for the week was a steal.

24
00:00:57,571 --> 00:00:59,838
Look at him, he is lithe.

25
00:00:59,907 --> 00:01:03,743
So a twink escort your rent, but -- 
That's different!

26
00:01:03,811 --> 00:01:07,413
I mean, they did ask if I wanted to
actually buy him, but I thought...

27
00:01:07,482 --> 00:01:08,915
What, that I'd
be weird about it?

28
00:01:08,984 --> 00:01:11,684
That I, perhaps
due to my race, might have a problem

29
00:01:11,753 --> 00:01:14,020
with the concept of
owning a human being?

30
00:01:14,088 --> 00:01:16,456
I actually just
thought I'd get tired of him.

31
00:01:16,524 --> 00:01:16,922
You?

32
00:01:16,991 --> 00:01:18,791
Mr. Can't Even Commit To A Pet?

33
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:19,492
Wh-?

34
00:01:19,561 --> 00:01:20,460
Yeah hi, two cats!

35
00:01:20,528 --> 00:01:24,663
One of whom I think has FIP, so...
commit that.

36
00:01:24,732 --> 00:01:26,932
You know how hard I
worked on this budget?!

37
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,202
Nights, weekends, canceled my
vacation, and now it's all wasted!

38
00:01:31,271 --> 00:01:34,139
Wasted, exactly,
let's go be that!

39
00:01:34,207 --> 00:01:38,610
C'mon, happy hour at
Pita Margarita's!

40
00:01:38,679 --> 00:01:40,846
Is...
that what it sounds like?

41
00:01:40,914 --> 00:01:44,182
Only if it sounds like a shitload
of tequila and some A-rab hoagies.

42
00:01:44,251 --> 00:01:45,751
How dare you?!

43
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:46,819
Arab, sorry.

44
00:01:46,887 --> 00:01:49,321
Oh shut up, how can you
even think about happy hour

45
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,791
at a time like this?!

46
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:57,297
When probably as we speak, my poor
Sterling is being tortured by pirates!

47
00:01:57,365 --> 00:01:58,765
I wish... What?!

48
00:01:58,834 --> 00:02:00,234
Wish you
wouldn't say that!

49
00:02:00,302 --> 00:02:07,341
- Because I'm sure he's not being tortured...
- Aaaaaaaaaaaagghhhhhhh!

50
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:12,646
Ohhhh my God, stop, stop, stop,
seriously I can't take anymore!
